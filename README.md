# Cryptopals
The goal of this repository is to learn about cryptography using the book Serious Cryptography and the Cryptopals challenges.

I am a physicist with a master’s degree in quantum computing, so my background in cryptography is quite limited.

I hope that those of you who take on these challenges find it helpful.

Best regards.
